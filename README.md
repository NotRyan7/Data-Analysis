# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains various data analysis projects that focus on extracting insights and building models using Python libraries.

## Projects Overview:
1. **Sales Data Analysis**  
   Analyzing sales trends over time and exploring relationships between region, powertrain type, and sales.

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Identifying different customer segments based on purchasing behavior.

3. **Market Trends Visualization**  
   Visualizing key market trends using advanced charting techniques.

4. **Regression Analysis**  
   Implementing regression models to predict and analyze data trends.
